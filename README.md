# Details:

This is a Chrome extension written by Jonathan Rankin and Michael Ruane.

This extension analyses Guardian articles and judges them based on:

i) Proportion of women who wrote the piece (worth 30/100 percentage points)

ii) Proportion of named women (worth 40/100 percentage points)

iii) Proportion of female pronouns (compared to male). (worth 30/100 percentage points).

An article that was jointly written by a man and a woman, which names the same number of women as men and uses the same number of
female and male pronouns scores 50. 

When on a front, a bar with the score will be displayed, and you can hover over the bar to see the breakdown.

The app uses Natural Language Processing to categories the names into Male and Female, and it is not perfect yet! This is firmly a BETA version, and if there are any issues that you spot, please let us know.
